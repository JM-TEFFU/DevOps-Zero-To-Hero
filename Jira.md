# What is JIRA?

JIRA is a software testing tool developed by the Australian Company Atlassian. It is a bug tracking tool that reports all the issues related to your software or mobile apps. The word JIRA comes from the Japanese word, i.e., "Gojira" which means Godzilla.

JIRA is based on the Agile methodology and the current version of the Jira is 6.

**The following are the useful aspects provided by the Jira:**

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-introduction.png)

- **Projects:** It is used to manage the defects very effectively.
- **Issue:** It is used to track and manage the defects/issues.

- **Workflow:** Processes the Issue/Defect life cycle. Suppose we have a business requirement, we create the technical design and from the technical design, we create the test cases. After creating the test cases, coding is done, and then testing is performed on the project. This design workflow is possible by using Jira.

- **Search:** Find with ease. Suppose we have done with a project at the beginning of the December and its version is 1.0. Now, we move to version 1.1 and completed at the end of December. What we are doing is that we are adding new versions. Through Jira, we can get to know that what happened in the earlier versions, how many defects occurred in the earlier projects and the learning we achieve from the earlier projects.

- **Dashboards:** Dashboard is a display which you see when you log in to the Jira. You can create multiple dashboards for multiple projects. You can create the personal dashboard and can add the gadgets in a dashboard so that you can keep track of the assignments and issues that you are working on.

 # Why JIRA?

##### JIRA tool is used because of the following reasons:

- **Plan, Track and Work Faster**<br>
JIRA is a bug-tracking tool mainly used to track, organize, and prioritize the bugs, newly added features, improvements for certain software releases. Projects are subdivided into issues and issues can be of multiple types such as bug, new feature, improvement, and documentation tasks.
When the release date of software comes near, then software developers need to focus on the remaining issues which are to be fixed before the specified date. It also becomes difficult for the QA to maintain the status of the documentation, i.e., sometimes it becomes hard to keep track of everything.
JIRA is a good choice for handling the above issues. It enables software developers to track issues and improvements. It manages the projects as well as maintain the technical documentation.

- **The main source of information**<br>
JIRA is the primary source of information for the next software release. On JIRA, the whole team of the software developers can plan for the new features which are to be added and bugs to be fixed in the next release.
It also helps the QA team in writing the technical documentation. Through JIRA, the QA team can check the status of each feature that is newly added by the software developers, and according to that, they can plan how to document for the new version.
- **Organize the documentation tasks**<br>
JIRA tool is used to organize the documentation tasks. It is useful in grouping the multiple tasks by using the component functionality, and even you can create your own documentation. In this way, you can create a structured way of documentation.
- **Track the progress of our documentation**<br>
It is a very useful tool in tracking the progress of our documentation. JIRA tool provides a very important feature, i.e., pie chart macro. In the pie chart macro, you can view tasks such as Open tasks, Closed tasks, Resolved tasks.

- **Helps to meet the deadlines of a documentation release.**
You can define the specific due date or deadline for the release of documentation, and even you can configure the JIRA tool with the notifications so that you can finish your documentation in time.
- **Measures the time spent on documentation**<br>
JIRA tool does not have the default functionality for measuring the time spent on documentation. JIRA tool is bundled with the Tempo Timesheets, which measures how much time has been spent on the documentation.
- **Provides feedback faster**<br>
JIRA tool provides the Confluence pages where you can connect to the issues in just a few clicks. If something needs to be updated, then you can create the issues directly from the Confluence page.

# Prerequisite
Before learning JIRA, you should have a basic understanding of manual testing.

# JIRA Installation

JIRA is a centralized software in which all the projects are logged into a central database and goes through the workflows. Workflow controls the status of the project.

# JIRA Waterfall Model

Before understanding the agile and JIRA, you must be aware of the waterfall model.

# What is a Waterfall model?

Waterfall model is the oldest model used by an IT industry to develop the software.

There are various models and processes which are used by different companies, but the waterfall model is the oldest, safest, and easy model in the IT industry.

It is the easiest model for building software that represents real life.

**Let's understand the Waterfall model.**

**Waterfall model is broken down into multiple phases:**

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-waterfall-model.png)

#### Requirements
Consider if there is a client and he wants to develop software, then the client reaches out to the company. Suppose he reaches out to the service-based company and asks the company to build the software for me.

#### What does the company do?
Company will collect all the requirements, the knowledge that the customer has or the client want to have on his software, the company will collect all the information from the client and prepare the documentation. Once this activity is performed, then the design phase gets started.

#### Design
In this phase, we prepare the high-level and low-level designs. Before developing the software, the design of the software is required. Suppose the customer wants e-commerce website similar to the Amazon, then UI(User Interface) of the website will be made by the designer and dataflows are also designed in this phase that how data will flow. Once this phase is completed, the development phase will get started.

#### Development
In the Development phase, the software development team starts coding and developing the software. This is the longest phase of the waterfall model as developers need more time to build the software. Once the development of the software is completed, then the project is handed over to the testers.

#### Testing
The testing team will test the software, and if any bug is found, then they inform the developers about the issue they found and make sure that the bug is fixed. They ensure that the end-to-end software is completed.

#### Deployment
Once the project is tested, the project is deployed so that it becomes live to the real-time users.

#### Maintenance
Finally, the project is deployed and available to the clients. Clients want the maintenance period for one or two years because if any bug is found or want a slightly enhanced feature in the project, so they need some team to handle such stuff. Due to this reason, they go for the maintenance period.

**Example of Waterfall model**

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-waterfall-model2.png)

Suppose the client wants an app like a WhatsApp, so he reaches to the company where both the company and the client had a discussion for 2 months. The company made the documentation of all the requirements in 2 months. Now, the development team starts developing the software and suppose it took around 10 months to develop the software. It means that 12 months have been used, i.e., 2 months in requirement phase and 10 months in a development phase, but still the client does not have the idea about the internal phases. Once the development is completed, testing is done, and it will take around 2 months for software quality testing. Once the testing is done, it goes to the integration and launch so that WhatsApp will become live. However, when it reaches to the client, then the client says that it has taken more than a year and the software that I received was not what I expected. This happened because the client had only verbal communication with the software team. If the client wants some changes in the software, then the whole process will be executed again.

# Advantages of the Waterfall model

- **Simple and easy to understand and use**<br>
It represents all the tasks that you want to do in real life. For example, you need the requirements of a client. It contains different phases, and each phase is started only when the previous phases get completed.

- **Specific deliverable and review process**<br>
Each phase has a specific deliverable and review process. After the requirement phase, we have all the requirements of what the customer needs. Once the software is developed, we have its deliverable.

- **Phases do not overlap**<br>
In this model, phases do not overlap, i.e., they are completed once at a time. Once the previous phase is completed, then only the next phase gets started. For example, the Development phase will start only when the design phase is completed.

# Disadvantages of the Waterfall model

- **Time to market is high**<br>
Product is released only when all the phases are completed. Therefore, this model takes a long time to release the product.

- **Unexpected results**<br>
What you expect and you receive are mostly different as the customer has an idea as per the documents only about the product. The client has only an idea, which is a documented idea.

- **Not suitable for changing requirements**<br>
This model is not suitable for the projects where requirements are at a moderate to high risk of changing. If the requirements are changing, then this model is not recommended as all the requirements are done at the requirement phase, which is a very time taking process.

# Agile

- Agile is a time-boxed, iterative approach to build the projects incrementally instead of all at once.

- Agile is a practice that promotes continuous iterations of development and testing throughout the software.

# What is NOT AGILE?

- **Conducting meetings**<br>
The team conducts frequent meetings for 10-15 minutes daily, and they think that conducting frequent meetings will be Agile. However, only the following meetings will not be Agile.

- **Requirements changing anytime**<br>
Requirements can be changed at any time, then it is not Agile. For example, a client wants to add some new features and want the changes to be updated at the same time, then this will not be Agile.

- **Unstructured development**<br>
Suppose you are not following any plan and you are working on Adhoc basis then it is not Agile wherein Adhoc testing, testers randomly test the application without following any documents and test design techniques.

- **No documentation**<br>
If the company does not make the documentation, then it is not Agile.


#### What is Agile?<br>
Agile is a philosophy, i.e., a set of values and principles to make a decision for developing software.
Agile is based on the iterative-incremental model. In an incremental model, we create the system in increments, where each increment is developed and tested individually.

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\agile.png)

The above diagram shows how agile model works incrementally.

# What are values?

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\values.png)

In Agile, you need to perform all the eight tasks which are mentioned in the above table. However, we have to make sure that the left task should be given higher priority than the right tasks.

- **Individuals and interactions, Over processes and tools**<br>
Suppose the team finds any issue in software then they search for another process or tool to resolve the issue. But, in Agile, it is preferable to interact with client, manager or team regarding issue and make sure that the issue gets resolved.

- **Working software, Over comprehensive documentation**<br>
Documentation is needed, but working software is much needed. Agile is not saying that documentation is not needed, but working software is much needed. For example, you have 20-page documents, but you do not have a single prototype of the software. In such a case, the client will not be happy because, in the end, the client needs a document.

- **Customer collaboration, Over contract negotiation**<br>
Contract negotiation is important as they make the budget of software, but customer collaboration is more important than over contract negotiation. For example, if you stuck with the requirements or process, then do not go for a contract which we have negotiated. You need to interact with the customer, gather their requirements.

- **Responding to change, over following a plan**
In the waterfall model, everything is planned, i.e., at what time, each phase will be completed. Sometimes you need to implement the new requirements in the middle of the software, so you need to be versatile to make changes in the software.

# Agile Principles

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. According to the Agile principle, the customer is everything for them. Whatever the customer needs, they have any issues or want to add new requirements, they always give priority to the customers. Listen to the customer what they are saying and provide the quality software to them.

- It welcomes changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer?s competitive advantage. In the waterfall model, if any new changes to be made in the middle of the software, the whole process is to be done again. Therefore, the waterfall model is rigid and not versatile. Agile says work like so that new changes can be easily incorporated in software.

- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. As in a waterfall model, when the whole system is developed then only it is delivered to the customer while Agile says that do not wait for too long, wait only for some weeks or months. Whatever you have developed, give a demo to the client, and this gives the glimpse of the software to the client that what you are developing at the initial phases.

- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. This means that the customer, client, and team should interact daily.

- Build projects around motivated individuals, give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. Agile says that believe on your team, customer, company. Suppose a task is given to the team member then provide all the resources whatever he needs such as documentation, system, information study, etc.

- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. Suppose there are situations when you need to interact with the client, development team which is usually done through mails or phone calls, but it is better to have face-to-face conversation.

- Working software is the primary measure of progress. Agile says that whatever has been developed is neither through documentation or what your project manager is saying, how much software has been developed or working is the measure of the progress.

- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. Agile says that make your team constant in delivery so that the team should have fixed working hours means if the company working timing is 8 hours then the team should work for 8 hours in a day.

- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility means that the team members should be technically sound so that they can make good designs if any changes are made, then they can be easily incorporated in the software.

- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from the self-organizing teams. Whatever the architecture team made designs, they make sure that they sit with the development team and discuss the architecture of the software.

- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. This principle says that the teams should frequently meet so that they can discuss the issues that they are facing and can be resolved effectively.

# Scrum
We have studied the Agile methodology where Agile is a set of beliefs which should be followed to develop the software development project. On these beliefs or values, there is many models have developed, and in which one of the models is a scrum.

**Before going to deep in Scrum, you should know the meanings of some basic terms:**

- **Scrum:** Scrum is an agile framework that helps you to organize, iterate, and continue the same project that you are working on. In scrum, a product is built in the series of iterations known as sprints or parts.

- **Sprint:** Sprint is a time-boxed period in which the scrum team needs to finish the set amount of work. Each sprint has a specified timeline, i.e., 2 weeks to 1 month. The scrum team agrees with this timeline during the sprint planning meeting.

- **Scrum Master:** Scrum Master is defined as a facilitator or servant-leader to the Scrum development team. Scrum Master must ensure that scrum principles are followed.

- **Scrum development team:** A scrum development team is a collection of individual members that includes developers, QA, and scrum master. It decides and provides the effort estimate. The recommended size of the scrum team is between 5 and 9 members.

# How does Scrum work

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\scrum.png)

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\scrum2.png)

In the Waterfall model, we have read that the first whole requirements are done, then the whole designing is done, then whole development is done, and then whole testing and deployment is done. This model takes full lifecycle of the product, and then the only product is viewable to the client. While Scrum says that consider a small part of the software and then plan it, build it, test and finally review it. This small module which has been developed will be shown to the customers. For example, we need to develop the e-commerce website, which can be broken into a number of sprints or modules such as login page, payment page, cart page, etc. Then, each module is developed individually and shown to the customers simultaneously. Therefore, we can say that after the completion of each sprint, the product is shipped to the client, though not the complete product but the part of the functionality

#### Artifacts of Scrum

The documentation and stuff which are prepared in scrum are known as Artifacts.

#### Following are the artifacts of Scrum:

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\scrum3.png)

- **Product Backlog**<br>
Product Backlog is a collection of activities that need to be done within the project. When we want to develop software, then we need to perform the 'n' number of activities. For example, we need to develop the e-commerce website then we have to do the 'n' number of activities such we need to create the login page, payment system, cart system, etc. and these 'n' number of activities which are needed to develop the software is known as the product backlog.

- **Sprint Backlog**<br>
We know that in a scrum, we break the scrum into 'n' number of sprints and the objective of a sprint is to bring the small functionality of the software and ship it to the client for demo. In Product backlog, we have to do all the activities which are required to develop the software while in the sprint backlog, a small set of product backlog activities are performed within that sprint. The 'n' number of sprint backlogs is equal to the 1 product backlog.

- **Burndown chart**<br>
Burndown chart is the outcome of the sprint, which shows the progress in a sprint. After each sprint, we need to examine the progress of each sprint. The burndown chart tells how you are working on the sprint. In the burndown chart, the graph starts from some time, i.e., where the activity gets started, and at the end of the sprint, the graph reaches to zero where the activity ends. It is generally an inclined line from top to bottom.

#### Scrum Roles
**There are three scrum roles:**

- **Product Owner**<br>
There is a client who wants to develop his software, so he approaches to the company who can develop his software. What does the company do? The Company assigns a role, i.e., Product Owner. Product Owner is the person who communicates with the clients understands their requirements. Product Owner is the responsible person from the company for software development.

- **Scrum Master**<br>
During the sprint, Agile says that the team should meet together once daily. When the team is following scrum means that they are conducting meetings daily for 10 to 15 minutes. This meeting is known as a scrum meeting. Scrum Master is the person who handles the scrum meeting.

- **Team**<br>
The team comprises of persons who work on the project. It can be developers, testers or designers. When we talk about Agile or Scrum then we talk about the team, we do not talk about developers, or testers as an individual. Agile says that developers can work as a tester or testers can work as a developer when the need arises.

#### Scrum Ceremonies
**Let's look at the following Scrum Ceremonies:**

- **Sprint Planning**
Scrum consists of a number of sprints which have a different set of modules used to deliver the software. Before starting the sprint planning, we have a meeting known as sprint planning, and in sprint planning, we discuss what we are going to do in a sprint. In sprint planning, product owner discusses about each feature of a product and estimates the effort involved by the development team.

- **Daily Scrum**<br>
In Scrum, meetings are conducted daily for 15 minutes by Scrum Master, where Scrum Master is the person who manages the meeting. Meeting consists of scrum master, developers, testers, designers, product owner, the client where product owner and client are optional.

- **Sprint Review**<br>
After the completion of each sprint, the meeting is conducted with a client in which a product is shown to the client for demo and team discuss the features they added in the project.

# Working of Sprint

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-working-of-sprint.png)

**Client, Stakeholders**<br>
Suppose there is a client who wants to develop their software, so they approach the service-based company to get their software to be developed.

**Product Owner**<br>

**What will the company do?**

Company will assign the person known as a product owner. The client interacts with the product owner, and the product owner will capture all the requirements or user stories from the client and which will be named as a Product Backlog.

**Product Backlog**<br>
Product Backlog is a set of activities that need to be done to develop the software.

**Sprint Planning**
Now, we will start a sprint. We won't be developing the product all at once as we have done in a waterfall model. We will consider some part of the product backlog, and that part will be developed first. To develop this particular part, some factors need to be taken into consideration, such as what is the priority, which components can be clubbed together, what features client needs, etc. Before starting the sprint, a meeting is held known as sprint planning, where we will discuss all the features. In sprint planning, we also select the activities or backlogs which will be developing within this sprint, and the selected backlogs are known as sprint backlog.

**Sprint Backlog**<br>
Sprint Backlog is a set of activities that need to be performed within this sprint. Out of the Product Backlog, a set of activities are captured in a sprint backlog, and each activity of a sprint backlog is assigned to a specific person. The minimum time to complete the sprint is 4 days, but it can be stretched to 2-3 weeks.

**Sprint**<br>
After Sprint Backlog, the team starts working on a sprint, and it can take around 1 to 3 weeks to complete the sprint. The completion of sprint varies from project to project. When sprint gets started, a daily meeting is conducted known as Daily Scrum, and the Scrum Master conducts this meeting. In Daily Scrum, a meeting is conducted daily, and the meeting can be stretched to 10-15 meetings. Meeting has a predefined format, i.e., a team member has to tell what he was doing yesterday, what he will do today, and what are the things which are hampering him to complete his work. It's the responsibility of the scrum master to resolve the issues faced by the team members.

**Sprint delivery**<br>
When a sprint is completed, then the sprint is delivered to the client. The product is delivered to the client means that minimum set of product backlog known as sprint backlog is completed. The sprint delivery is done so that the client can view the product, it's not that we have developed something and client cannot view.

**Sprint Review and Retrospective**<br>
Once the sprint delivery is over, there are two types of meetings held, i.e., sprint review and retrospective. The sprint review is a meeting in which team members sit together, and they give the demo to the client about the product that they have developed in this sprint.

**A retrospective** is another meeting which is held between team members. In this meeting, they discuss what is right in this sprint and what went wrong in this sprint, such as the issues hampering their work.

After sprint review, we go back to the Product Backlog and then sprint planning is done to select the sprint backlog, i.e., sprint2, in this way, this cycle goes on until and unless the whole product is developed and shipped to the client.

**Scrum Board**

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-working-of-sprint2.png)

**Product Backlog:** Product Backlog is a set of activities that need to be done to develop the software.

**Sprint Backlog:** Sprint Backlog is a backlog that has taken some of the activities from the product backlog which needs to be completed within this sprint.

**Scrum Board:** Scrum Board is a board that shows the status of all the activities that need to be done within this sprint.

**Scrum Board consists of four status:**

**Open**<br>
The 'Open' status means that the tasks which are available in **'Open'** are not yet started.

**In progress**<br>
The 'In progress' status means the developers completed their tasks.

**Testing**
The 'testing' means that the task is in a testing phase.

**Closed**
The 'closed' means the task has been completed.

# Kanban Methodology

Kanban is the most popular agile framework after Scrum for software development. It provides the real-time and transparency of work. In Kanban board, all the tasks are visible that allows the team members to see the state of every task at any time.

#### Characteristics of Kanban methodology:
- **Flexibility**<br>
In Kanban methodology, a team focusses on the work that is 'in progress' state. Once the team completed its task, then it pulls the next first task of the product backlog. A product owner reprioritizes the tasks or made changes in a product backlog outside the team, so this will not disrupt or impact the team. A product owner keeps the most important task on the top of the product backlog, so the development team assures that they will produce the most valuable output. In Kanban, we do not need to do the fixed-length iteration as we did in the scrum.

- **Minimize time cycles**<br>
The cycle time is the amount of time taken by the work to travel from the moment it gets started to the moment it gets shipped to the customers. An overlapping skill set can minimize the cycle time. In this, developers not only write the code but can also test the code whenever required. This type of sharing skills means the team members can take the heterogeneous work which optimizes the cycle time.

- **Visual metrics**<br>
Visual metrics is a way of improving team efficiency and team effectiveness. A visual metric is shown through charts, and team members can view the data in charts, and can spot the issues arises in their process. The main goal of the visual metric is to reduce the amount of time taken by the issues to move through the entire process.
**There are two types of charts used by the kanban team:**
**Control charts:** It shows the cycle time taken by each issue.
**Cumulative flow diagrams:** It shows the number of issues present in each state.

- **Continuous delivery**<br>
The main aim of continuous delivery to deliver the product with low risk rapidly. The transition from the agile methods to continuous delivery move the two-three weeks sprint to the Kanban methodology. Both Kanban methodology and continuous delivery complement each other by delivering the product to the customers faster. Software development teams are used to develop, test, and review the new features in a continuous manner. Therefore, we can say that Kanban is a continuous flow methodology.

**Kanban Board**

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-kanban-methodology.png)

Kanban board is a tool used to visualize the work and limit work-in-progress.

As in scrum, we are taking some activities from a product backlog and adding in a sprint backlog. However, in Kanban, we do not have sprint, so sprint backlog activity will not be performed. This is the main difference between scrum and Kanban that scrum contains sprint backlog while kanban does not contain the sprint backlog.

Kanban board consists of three states:

- To Do
- Doing
- Done

When the project is started, then we put all the activities from the product backlog to the **'To Do'** state. When the team member starts working on an activity, then that activity is put in a **'Doing'** state, and when the activity is placed, then it is placed in a **'Done'** state.

From the Kanban board, one can get to know which activities have been done and which activities they need to develop.

One of the most important features of the Kanban board is a **Limit** option. In the above figure, we have eight tasks in a product backlog and limit set is 4. At a time, it will take only four tasks in a **'To Do'** state, and if any of the tasks come in a **'Doing'** state, then one more task from the product backlog will be placed in a **'To Do'** state. In this way, we can set the **limit** depending on the availability of the resources.

# What is an Issue?

JIRA Issue is used to track the individual pieces of work that has been completed or not. JIRA issue can be a software bug or any other issue. Once you have imported the project in Jira, you can create issues.

#### Issue types
Teams work together to break down the pieces of work into issues. Issues can represent software bugs, a project task, subtasks, or any other project work. Jira project comes with the default issue type, and you can also create your own issue type.

An issue type is a generic name for the unit of work. In Jira, we have different units of work in a project, and issue types field differentiate this.

When you create an issue, then you need to specify the issue type. You can even change the issue type after creating the issue.

Each issue has an icon associated with it to identify the issue type.

**Custom Issue type:** It is also used to create the customization issue type that provides the flexibility to the team to create their own issue types according to their projects.

The below screen shows the list of Issue types:

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-issues.png)

**There are three types of Issue types:**

- **JIRA Core Default Issue types**
- **Task:** The task is a work item done by the team but not connected directly to the user's requirements. For example, to upgrade the version of a product used by the teams.

- **Subtask:** It is a part of another issue. It is used to break an issue into different pieces of work. While creating an issue, sub task issue is not given in the issue type field drop-down as it contains some parent issue, so we can say that subtask issue cannot be created independently.

**JIRA Software default issue types**<br>
- **Story:** It is a requirement from the user's perspective.
- **Bug:** It is a flaw in a product that needs to be fixed by the developers. It can be tracked with its own issue type to differentiate from other types of work.
- **Epic:** An epic is a big issue that contains other issues.

**JIRA Service desk default issue types**
- Incident
- Service Request
- Change
- Problem

**Why Issue types?**<br>
**Issue types are used because of the following reasons:**

- They support multiple work items. Usually, teams contain multiple work items, and issue types are used to differentiate these work items.

- Each Issue type can have different fields, screens, and workflows. For example, the bug appears on the top of the project board.

- You can report issue types separately. Issues are categorized by issue types; for example, you want to report the progress of your work of the previous week.

**Subtask**

- Subtask is an issue type that must have a parent issue.
- To create a subtask, click on the create subtask icon for the parent issue.

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-issues2.png)

- It converts an issue into individual manageable tasks, and each task is assigned to the team members.

- Subtask is more technical than the parent issue. For example, the type of issue is the Story, then the lines written in story will be non-technical, so that team members and stakeholders can understand. But the subtasks are written in technical line implementing subtasks.

**Subtask Characteristics**

Subtask has its own issue key and fields.
Subtasks have independent workflow status
Subtask issue type can be converted into another issue.

**Converting a Sub-task to issue**

- Move to the details of a subtask and then click on the **more(...)** button, and then click on the **Convert to Issue.**

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-issues3.png)

On clicking on the **Convert to Issue**, the screen appears which is shown below. You can select the issue type of your choice.

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-issues4.png)
**Converting an issue into Subtask**
- Open the issue that you want to convert into a subtask.
- Click on the **on (...)** button, then drop down menu will be opened.

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-issues5.png)

Click on the **Convert to Subtask** menu item. On clicking on the Convert to Subtask, the screen appears which is shown below:

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-issues6.png)

In the above screen, select the parent issue and then click on the Next>>.

- The below screen shows that Step 2 is not required. Click on the Next>>.


![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-issues7.png)

The below screen is Confirmation. Click on the **Finish** button.

# JIRA Workflow

Workflow is a set of activities which are performed to track the status and the transition of an issue during the lifecycle of an issue.

Where **transition** represents some work in the form of link between the two statuses when an issue moves from one status to another.

**Status:** Status determines the impact of the work on the issue which is filed by the tester.

**In Jira tool, following are the phases that occur in the workflow:**

- **TODO state**
- **In Progress state**
- **Done state**



![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-workflow.png)

- **Issue creation**<br>
When the tester finds a defect, then they log the defect in Jira tool. Once the defect is logged in a Jira tool, the unique ticket identification number is generated by a Jira tool. This process is known as issue creation.

- **Summary and additional details**<br>
Issue creation requires some additional information which is to be added or updated to an issue such as issue description, priority, severity, components impacted, subtasks, upload screenshots, email history, etc. After adding all the details to an issue, Jira tool assigns the status as a TODO state.

**There are three activities performed in the In Progress state:**

- **Assignee**<br>
When the issue is created, then it is assigned to a person or a team. After assigning the issue to a person, then the status changes to In Progress state.

- **Work Review**<br>
Work on the issue is first reviewed and monitored by the issue reporter, assignee, and other project's management folks. When the developer removes an issue, then it is first unit tested by the developer, and then the code review team reviews it. During the work review activity, the status remains in the In Progress state.

- **Quality Analysis**<br>
After code review, the changes are verified by the quality analysis team, which includes regression testing. If the QA team finds any problem in the changes, then the issue is reassigned to the developer otherwise QA team will close the issue which states that the issue has been fixed. During the Quality Analysis, the status remains in the **In Progress** state.

One activity is performed in the **Done** state:

- **Release to production** Once the product has been developed and tested, then the product is released in the market. When the product is released in the market, then the status is changed to Done state.

**JIRA Workflow can also be referred to as a defect lifecycle. The defect lifecycle is shown below:**

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-workflow2.png)


- **Open issue:** When the issue is created, then the issue is assigned to the software developer, and they start working on it.

- **In Progress issue:** The software developers start working on the issue.

- **Resolved issue:** Issue is resolved by the software developer but waiting for the verification by the tester. If the verification is successful, then the issue is closed; otherwise, the issue gets reopened.

- **Reopened issue:** When the software developer did not resolve the issue as per the requirements, then the issue comes in a reopened state.

- **Close issue:** When the software developer correctly resolves the issue and verified by the software tester, then the issue will be closed

# JIRA Login

**The following are the steps to login to Jira:**

To Login to Jira, move to the website that we created in **Jira.** The login page appears and then you need to fill the credentials such as username and password.<br>
**Click on the continue button.**

# JIRA Dashboard

When you log in to Jira, the first screen that will appear is Dashboard. The Dashboard can only be customized by the Admin, and based on the roles, an admin can access to Jira.

An admin can even change the color and the Jira logo.

You can create multiple dashboards that help you to organize your projects, assignments, and achievements in different charts.

## Default Dashboard

You can add the gadgets in a default dashboard as well as you can configure the default dashboard. The layout of the dashboard can also be configured, such as a number of columns. All the changes made to the default dashboard will also reflect the changes in the dashboard of the users that are currently using the default dashboard. For example, the Administration gadget exists in the Default dashboard, but it is visible to only admin.

**Following are the steps which can be used to add the gadget in default dashboard:**

- Login to the Jira website.

##

**Jira Issue types**

JIRA application can be used to break the pieces of work into issues. Issues can be represented as tasks, subtasks, bud, epic, feature requests, or other pieces of work. Each Jira software comes with some default issue types that suit your projects and teams.

**There are three types of default Jira issue types that come with the JIRA software:**


![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-issue-types.png)

- Jira Core (business projects) issue types
- Jira Software (software projects) issue types
- Jira Service desk (service desk projects) issue types

## 

**Jira Core issue types**

- **Task**<br>
The task is the work which is to be completed or done to achieve the team's goal.

- **Subtask**<br>
It is the subtask of an issue. All the tasks that come under the logged issue are known as subtasks

##

**Jira Software issue types**
- **Bug**<br>
A bug is the problem or defect that occurs in the functions of a product.

- **Epic**

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-issue-types2.png)

- Epic is a large user story which is to be broken into smaller stories.

- It cannot be achieved in a single sprint.
- The whole epic is completed in months.
- Epic refers to a set of activities which are not converted into user stories yet.
- First, Epics are converted into user stories, and then user stories are converted into several tasks on which agile team work.
- Epics are broad in scope and lacking details, and they split into smaller and multiple stories on which agile team work on.
- Epic is referred to as a 'top-tier in the work hierarchy.

**Subtask**<br>
Subtask is a piece of work which is to be done to complete the whole work.

**Task**<br>
The task is the work which is to be completed or done to achieve the team's goal.

**Story**<br>
The story is a list of tasks that need to be completed within a project.
It defines the high-level design of project requirements.
It defines the short and simple descriptions of the whole project.
It is owned by the product owner of a company, but anyone can write the user story.
It is written in simple language so that customers can understand the final product.
User stories can be considered as the **"heart of scum"** as it serves as the building blocks for the sprint.

##

**Jira Service Desk issue types**

**Change**<br>
It requests a change in the current IT profile.

**IT help**<br>
It is used to request for help for an IT related problem.

**Incident**<br>
It reports an incident or service IT outage.

**New feature**<br>
It is requesting to add a new feature or software capability.

**Problem**<br>
It is used to report the root cause of multiple incidents.

**Service Request**<br>
It is used for requesting help from an internal or customer service desk.

**Service Request with approval**<br>
It is used for requesting help that requires manager or board approval.

**Support**<br>
It is used for requesting help for the customer support issues.

##

# Jira Backlog

A backlog is a set of activities or issues that the team needs to be resolved within a specific iteration. All the issues of your project are grouped in a backlog and sprint.

In scrum backlog, you can perform the multiple activities such as create and update issues, drag and drop the issues to prioritize them, assign them to sprints, epics, versions, manage epics, etc.

**The following are the activities that can be performed in the scrum backlog:**

- **Add issues to the backlog**<br>
To add an issue in the backlog, you need to create an issue. Click on the + icon in the global sidebar to create an issue. Fill all the details related to an issue, and then click on the create button. An issue which you have created will be added to the backlog.

- **Prioritize the backlog**<br>
You can also drag and drop an issue so that you can prioritize the issue in a backlog. You can also right-click on the issue to open the menu that allows you to move the issue to the top or the bottom in a backlog.

- **View and edit an issue's details**<br>
Click an issue on the board to view all the details of the issue. If you want to see the issue in a separate window, then right-click on the issue key.

- **Identify the workload for users**<br>
The users to whom the work assigned are shown at the top of the sprint. Click on the '...' option to view the workload for assignees.

- **Create subtasks**<br>
Click on an issue, and then click on the Jira Backlog icon to create the subtask. Subtasks are useful for breaking a story into implementable parts.

- **Transition an issue**<br>
You can drag and drop an issue from the Backlog section to the relevant sprint, or we can say that we can move the issue from the Backlog section to the relevant sprint.

- **Split an issue**<br>
Right click on the issue and then select the split issue. It can split the issue in Backlog as well as in the sprint section. Splitting is useful when you want to break the big task into two or more issues to make the work more manageable.

- **Delete an issue**
You can also delete an issue by selecting an issue, and then select **...>Delete.**

- **Find issue**<br>
You can create your own Quick Filters to view only those issues that you want.

**Steps to create a backlog**
- Click on the + appearing on the leftmost side of the pane.

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-backlog2.png)

- Fill all the details to create an issue.
![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-backlog3.png)
![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-backlog4.png)
![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-backlog6.png)

In the above form, fill all the mandatory details, and leave other fields with their blank or default values.



**Mandatory fields are:**

- **Project:** It defines the name of the project. Suppose I have given the name of the project as 'Test project'.

- **Issue Type**
It defines the type of issue. It can be a bug, epic, story, etc.

- **Summary**
It tells the overall description of an issue.
Priority
It defines the priority of an issue. It can be either medium, low, or high.
Suppose I have created an issue whose type is Bug and description is "Login Button is not working", and priority of an issue is high.

# Jira Scrum Board

Jira Scrum Board is a tool used to unite the teams to achieve a single goal and incremental-iterative delivery.

**Functions of Scrum Board**<br>

- **Increase communication and transparency**
Jira Scrum board is the single source through which all the work of a team can be accessed by a team member at any time. This increases communication among the team members and transparency.

- **Promote sprint planning and iterative development**
The heart of the Scrum framework is a sprint, which is a fixed amount of time for teams to build a releasable product increment. Jira scrum board is mainly designed so that the teams can organize their work within the sprint timeframe.

- **Improve team focus and organization**
Sometimes teams forget the project deadlines, and they are over-committed on their workload. Jira Scrum Boards provide transparency to the team's work by dividing the work into multiple stages and providing the burndown and velocity reports.

**Following are the important terms related to a Scrum Board:**

- **Sprint**<br>
A sprint is a time-boxed iteration of time which is mainly of 2 weeks. When the sprint is completed, then it produces the most valuable, useable, and releasable product in the market.

- **Backlog**<br>
The Backlog is owned by the Product owner. Product Backlog is a list of features, defects, enhancements, experiments that are to be considered in the product.

- **User story**<br>
    A user story is the smallest unit of work in an agile framework. A User story is a goal, not a feature which is expressed in terms of the user's perspective.

    The purpose of a user story is to show how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the customer.
    User stories are the sentences written in simple language to provide the desired outcome.

    It should be in a granular format so that it can be delivered within a sprint. Sprint is nothing but a time-bound iteration to deliver the working software.

    User story comes under the epic, and epic is a large chunk of work, user stories come under the epic. Some user stories are taken from the epic and placed in a particular sprint. This cycle goes on until and unless all the user stories within a sprint are completed.

- **Issue**<br>
An issue is also known as user story. In scrum board, an issue contains all the tasks, dependencies, and other relevant information required to perform a single piece of work.

- **Epic**<br>
Epic is a large chunk of work. It is basically a large user story which can be broken into a number of smaller stories. All the user stories in the epic might take several sprints to complete.

- **Swimlane**<br>
Swimlane is a means of categorizing of issues in an active sprint of a scrum board or a kanban board. It helps you to distinguish the tasks of different categories, such as users, workstreams, etc.

**Layout of the Scrum Board**<br>
The Scrum Board is a physical board on which the user stories present in the current sprint backlog are displayed.


![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\layout-of-scrum-board.png)

**Scrum board is divided into columns such as:**

- **Stories:** This column contains all the user stories available in the current sprint backlog.

- **TODO:** This state contains the subtasks of the stories on which the work has not started on.

- **In Progress:** This state contains all the tasks on which the work has started.

- **Done:** This state contains all the tasks on which the work have been completed.

**Steps to create a Scrum project**

- Click on the **projects** appearing on the left side of the page.

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\layout-of-scrum-board2.png)

- Click on the **Create Project** button to create a new project appearing at the top right corner of the page.

- Click on the template link.

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\layout-of-scrum-board3.png)

- Enter the project name.

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\layout-of-scrum-board5.png)

- In the below image, TP Board is created, which is the short name for the project named as **"Test project".**

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\layout-of-scrum-board6.png)
The whiteboard shown in the above image is the Jira board, which consists of issues related to a particular project.

Displaying the issues on a scrum board provides the flexibility for viewing, managing, and tracking the progress of an issue.

The backlog is empty for the newly created project. It is filled only when you add the tasks or an issue in the Backlog.

# What is Sprint?

The team needs to complete a set of issues within a specified time period, known as a sprint. The duration of the sprint is decided by both the team and the product owner.

## Creating a Sprint
**Following are the steps to create a sprint:**

- Click on the Backlog appearing on the left-hand side as shown below in the screenshot:

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-create-sprint.png)

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-create-sprint13.png)

# What is board?

A board displays all the issues that occurs within the project, providing you a flexible way of viewing, managing, and reporting the progress on work.

**There are three types of boards that exist in Jira:**

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-board.png)

- **Next-gen board**<br>
This board is useful for those who are new to the agile. It is a very simplified, straight-forward, and streamlined board.

- **Scrum board**<br>
This board is useful when teams work on sprints that includes a backlog.

- **Kanban board**
Kanban board is an agile project management tool designed for the visualization of work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency.
##
**Scrum board**<br>
**Scrum board is divided into three parts:**

- **Backlog**<br>
The backlog is a set of activities or issues available in a project. All the issues are grouped in a backlog and sprint. In scrum backlog, you can create and update the issue, drag and drop issue and assign them to sprints, drag, and drop the issue to rank them.

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-board2.png)

The above screen shows the backlog which contains an issue **TP-1** whose description is that **login button is not working.**

- **Active sprint**<br>
Active sprint is a sprint that contains the issues on which the team is currently working on. You can also drag and drop the issue and assign it back to the backlog.

**Steps to create an active sprint:**
- Click on the Backlog. After clicking on the Backlog, the screen appears, which is shown below:

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-board3.png)
The above screen shows the Backlog which contains an issue **"Login button is not working".**

- Click on the **Create sprint** button to create a sprint. On clicking on the Create sprint button, the screen appears, which is shown below:

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-board4.png)
The above screen shows that sprint is created named as **Sprint 1.**

- Drag and drop the issue from backlog to Sprint 1.

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-board5.png)
In the above screen, we observe that the issue has been dragged from the backlog to Sprint 1, and the issue is removed from the backlog.

- Click on the **start sprint** button to make an active sprint.
- Click on the **Active sprint** appearing on the left-side of the panel.

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-board6.png)
The above screen shows that Sprint 1 is an active sprint on which the team is currently working on.

- **Reports**
Reporting is an activity that will be performed throughout the project. Reports are made which are used to show the information about your project, versions, epic, sprints, and issues.

##

**Kanban board**<br>
Kanban is a process that provides the visualization of all the work which you are doing today.

**Kanban consists of three parts:**

- **Backlog**<br>
Kanban has a separate column of Backlog from where we plan the work for our team. Planning of work in a small column becomes very difficult, so by using the kanban backlog that provides a bigger space for handling the issues.

**Steps to create a backlog in the kanban framework:**

- Create an issue. When we create an issue, then it is added to the Backlog automatically.

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-board7.png)
The above screen shows that HEL-1 issue that we created is added to the backlog.

**Kanban board**<br>
Kanban is a process based on the continuous delivery of work. In Kanban framework, rather than planning the iterations, the flow of work is continuously monitored means that when the tasks are completed, then the new task is added in **In Progress** state.

**Kanban board consists of three states:**
- **Selected for development**
- **In Progress**
- **Done**

**Reports**

Reporting is an activity that will be performed throughout the project. Reports are made which are used to show the information about your project, versions, epic, sprints, and issues.

##
**Next-gen board**

Next-gen board is the same as classic scrum and kanban board. However, next-gen does not provide all the features in the beginning, it provides the feature only when you need. The Next-gen project can be done in two templates, i.e., Next-gen Scrum and Next-gen Kanban.

How to create a Next-gen project


**Next-gen project can be created in the following steps:**
- Click on the **Create project** drop-down menu and then select the **Try next-gen** project option.


![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-board8.png)
After clicking on the Try next-gen project, the screen appears, which is shown below:

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-board9.png)

The above screen shows that we have chosen the Scrum template, we can also change the template by clicking on the link Change template. After selecting the template, enter the project name, we have given the Testing project as a project name. Click on the Create button.

- After clicking on the **create** button, Next-gen Scrum project is created, which is shown below:

# JIRA Bug Life Cycle

JIRA bug life cycle is also known as a defect life cycle. The bug life cycle consists of a set of states that a bug goes through. The number of states that the bug goes through varies from project to project. We can define the bug as an error, flaw or we can say that when the actual output does not match with the expected output, it is known as bug or defect. Both the terms, i.e., bug and defect are commonly used but the most popular is a bug. A bug can be generated at any stage of the **SDLC**(Software Development Life Cycle), it could exist in requirements gathering, designing phase where SRS document is designed, development phase, testing phase or user acceptance testing done by the end-user at the time of using the application.

A bug has its life cycle from the point when the bug is logged in to the point the bug is closed. Bug undergoes the following states:

- New
- Assigned
- Open
- Fixed
- Retesting
- Reopen
- Verified
- Closed

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-bug-life-cycle.png)

##

**New**<br>
During the time of the testing phase, the bug or defect is identified by the tester and it is logged in to the bug tracking tool such as Jira, Bugzilla, etc. The bug which is detected by the tester will be posted for the first time in a bug tracking tool. This status is assigned as a **New** status.

**Assigned**<br>
Bug with **New** status is assigned to the software developers and they will look into the bug to check whether the bug is valid or invalid. If the bug is invalid then they change the status to invalid. If the bug is valid then the status is changed to **assigned** then the software developers start working on the defect to get fixed.


**Open**
When the bug is assigned to the software developers then they start analyzing on it and works on the defect fix. The bug or defect can be opened in three stages:

- **Duplicate**
If the defect is repeated twice or the defect corresponds to the same concept of the previous bug, then it changes the status to Duplicate.

- **Rejected**
If the developer feels that the defect is not a genuine defect, then it changes the status to Rejected.

- **Deferred**
If the bug is not of higher priority and can be solved in the next release, then the status changes to Deferred. The deferred state is also known as postpone state.

- **Fixed**<br>
When a developer makes a necessary code changes and verifies the change, then he/she can make the bug status as fixed. When the bug is fixed by the developers then the status is changed to either Reopened or Verified.

- **Retest**<br>
Once the bug is fixed by the software developers then it is assigned back to the testing team to check whether the bug has been fixed or not.

- **Reopen**<br>
If the bug persists even after the developer has fixed the bug, then tester changes the status to Reopen and once again bug goes through the whole bug life cycle.

- **Verified**<br>
The tester retests the bug after it got fixed by the developer if no bug found then it changes the status to Verified.

- **Closed**<br>
If the bug is no longer exists, then it changes the status to Closed.

**Participants of Bug life cycle**

- **Bug Reporter**
The person who identifies the bug is known as Bug Reporter. Bug reporter validates the bug and enters all the bug related details into the bug tracking tool such as correct subject, bug priority, application component, test environment, bug assignee, bug description. When required, the tester needs to send the attached screenshot to clarify the bug details.

- **Bug tracking tool**<br>
A bug can be logged in to the bug tracking tool and bug tracking tool can be Jira, Bugzilla, Assembla, etc.

- **Bug Group**<br>
Bug Group is a group of people who can see the bug details. Bug Group can include tester or end user who reported the bug, the developers to whom the bug is assigned, project manager, QA manager.

- **Bug Owner**<br>
Bug owner is the person who reviews and owns the bug. Bug owner checks whether the bug information is sufficient or not, if not then the bug is assigned back to the bug reporter to provide more information. Based on the priorities given to the bug, Bug owner takes the ownership of the bug and get fixed it within the deadline.

 # Jira vs. Bugzilla

 Jira and Bugzilla are widely used bug tracking tools by large organizations. Nowadays both the tools are in huge demand these days, but both the tools differ in performances. Let's first look at the key points of both the tools, and then we will look at the differences between both the tools.

## Jira

Jira is a bug tracking tool developed by an Australian company Atlassian in 2002. It is used for project management, issue tracking, and bug tracking. Jira is not an open-source tool, i.e., Jira software is not available at free of cost; it's a paid service.

#### Advantages of Jira software

- Jira tool is useful for functional testing.
- It is used to prioritize the tasks.
- One can easily get to know about the next release of the build as Jira tool provides better visibility.
- It provides a better flexibility workflow so that the team can adjust accordingly.

### Bugzilla

Bugzilla is also a bug tracking tool developed by the Mozilla Foundation in 1998. It is a quite popular reporting tool which is having a simple user interface. Due to its simple interface, beginners take no time to understand its workflow.

### Advantages of Bugzilla

- It improves the quality of the product.
- It enhances the communication between the developing team and the testing team.
- It has the capability to adapt to multiple situations.

#### Differences between Jira & Bugzilla

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-vs-bugzilla.png)
#### The following are the differences between Jira and Bugzilla are:

- **License**<br>
Jira software is available to only those who are the commercial license owners while Bugzilla software is an open-source tool, i.e., it is available without any license.

- **Server side architecture**
The server-side architecture of Jira software is built on MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Perl while the server-side architecture of Bugzilla software is built on J2EE, Tomcat, Lucene, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL.

- **Server Load**<br>
Server load in Bugzilla is considerably low as compared to the Jira software. In Bugzilla, multiple instances can run on one server without much overhead while Jira is a complex system that executes most of the server-side code per web request due to which server load is considerably higher. It is recommended to have powerful hardware for Jira, i.e., modern CPU and 1 GB of memory. According to the Atlassian community, do not store more than 200,000 issues on a single JIRA instance.

- **Drag-and-Drop issue prioritization**<br>
Drag-and-Drop issue prioritization feature is available in Jira but not in Bugzilla. In Jira, you can easily drag and drop the issues based on the priority of the issues, but this will not be possible in Bugzilla.

- **Dashboard with customized gadgets**<br>
Gadgets provide a summary of all the details, such as the team's progress, reports, etc. Jira provides the feature "Dashboard with customized gadgets" in which you can customize the gadgets according to your needs, but this feature is not available in Bugzilla.

- **Real-time release tracking**<br>
One of the most important thing during the development of the software is the visibility. Jira overcomes this problem by providing the communication between the development team and testing team due to which the team members can get to know that "when the task is started" and "when the task will be completed". This feature is not available in Bugzilla.

- **Attachments**<br>
In Jira, multiple files can be attached at a time while in Bugzilla, only a single file can be added at a time.
Size limit for file attachment
The size limit for file in Jira is 10 mb while the size limit for file attachment in Bugzilla is 1mb.

- **Kanban support**<br>
Jira supports the kanban projects, but Bugzilla does not support the kanban projects.

- **User Interface**<br>
Jira user interface is much better than the user interface of Bugzilla. In Jira, a lot of effort has been made to improve the user interface, but in Bugzilla, the interface has not changed much over the years.

- **Custom Field Types**
Custom field types available in Bugzilla are text fields, multi-selection, drop-down, bug id. There are too many field types available in Jira, and even more custom field types available from the plugins.

- **Workflow**<br>
In Bugzilla, admin defines the global workflow for all the products by editing transition matrix while Jira allows the users to define the multiple workflows based on the issue and project's type and an issue undergoes a multiples states.

- **Search Power**<br>
Bugzilla provides an advanced search feature, but Jira has more flexible Jira query language that provides more powerful search feature for creating the project status and monitoring the project's progress.

# Jira Epic

- Jira epic is a large user story which is broken into smaller tasks (user stories) based on the customer or end-user needs.
- Based on the customer needs, the task is added or removed from the epic as necessary.
- Epics are used to organize the work and to create a hierarchy.
- Epics maintain the agility by organizing larger tasks into smaller tasks.
- Epic is the top-tier of the work hierarchy, which is used by the developers.
- Epics are larger stories which have distinct start and end.
- Epics can span to multiple sprints, i.e., the epics are delivered over the multiple sprints.
- Epics can contain stories, bugs, and tasks within them, and grouping them makes a large story.
- When epics contain stories, bugs, or tasks, then all these issue types are represented at the same level in a hierarchy in Jira.
- Stories, bugs, tasks represent a single piece of work, while epic is a group of related issues.

**Let's understand the structural flow of an Epic:**

Epics are composed of multiple stories, while Initiatives are made up of Epics. Therefore, we can say that initiatives come above the epics. Initiative takes the Epics from the multiple teams to achieve a bigger goal than any of the Epics can achieve themselves.

# Jira Versions

Versions are used to organize and schedule the releases. If the version is created and issues are assigned to it, then we can use the version to filter information in various reports.

You can assign issues to a specific version and can organize the sprints in that version

**Creating a Version**<br>

**Step 1:** Move to your project.

**Step 2:** Click on the Releases appearing at the left side of the panel.

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-versions.png)

**Step 3:** After clicking on the **Releases link**, the screen appears, which is shown below:

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-versions2.png)

**Step 4:** Click on the Create version button.

**Step 5:** On clicking on the **Create version** button, the pop-up window appears asking for the version name and its description.

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-versions3.png)

**Adding issues to version**

**Step 1:** Move to your project.

**Step 2:** Click on the Backlog appearing at the left side of the panel.

**Step 3:** Click on the Versions panel.

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-versions4.png)

**Step 4:** Drag the issue to a version that you want to add in a version.

**Complete a version**
You can complete a version when your version is ready to be released. The version is ready to be released when issues are completed, and code is checked and reviewed.

**Step 1:** Navigate to your project.

**Step 2:** Click on the **Releases link** appearing at the left side of the panel.

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-versions5.png)
**Step 3:** To release the version, go to ellipsis (...) > Release.

# Jira Reports
Reports are used to track and analyze the team's performance throughout a project.

Jira has a range of reports that shows the information about your project, versions, sprints, epics, and issues.

**Following are the reports generated by report:**

**Average age report**

An average age report shows the average age of unresolved issues for a project or a filter. It helps you to show whether the backlog is kept up-to-date or not.

**Average age report can be shown as below:**


![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-reports.png)

The above screen shows the average age of all the unresolved issues over the past 30 days.

**Pie chart**<br>
The pie chart displays the issues which are returned from the specified project or an issue filter. We can create an issue filter that retrieves all the issues belonging to a specific version of a particular project. The pie chart is created to group all the issues belonging to a specific statistic type, and statistic type can be Assignee, project, etc.

Suppose I choose the statistic type as **Assignee.**

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-reports1.png)

The above screen shows the pie chart based on the "Assignee" type. The above chart shows that the one issue is assigned to the Akshita Gupta, and the other four issues are unassigned.

**Created vs. Resolved issue**
The created vs. resolved issue is a report that displays the number of issues which are created and resolved over a given period of time.

This report is created based on the project and issue filter that the user chooses and the chart can either be cumulative or not.

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-reports2.png)

**Recently Created Issues Report**
The recently created issues report displays the number of issues that are created, and some of the issues are resolved.

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-reports3.png)

In the above screen, the red portion shows that that issues are created and they are unresolved while the green color shows that the issues are created, but they are resolved.

**Resolution Time Report**
The resolution time report determines the length of the time taken to resolve the issues for a project/filter.

**Single Level Group By Report**
Single level group by report categorizes the issues by a particular field for an issue filter, but it does not display the chart.

![DevOps Architecture](Jira-images\jira-reports4.png)

The above screen shows that one issue, i.e., HEL-1, is assigned while other four issues, i.e., HEL-5, HEL-3, HEL-2, HEL-4, are unassigned. The Single Level Group By Report shows the progress of both assigned and unassigned issues.

**Time Since Issues Report**
The Time Since Issues Report generates the report that shows the number of issues for the chosen data field, and the data field can be Created, Updated, Due, Resolved.
